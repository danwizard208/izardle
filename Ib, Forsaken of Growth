Mana cost: {C}{W}{U}{B}{R}
Legendary Creature Enchantment - Avatar

Whenever a land enters the battlefield under an opponent's control,
if that player had another land enter the battlefield under his or her control this turn,
that player may pay {2}.
If that player doesn't, Ib, Forsaken of Growth does 2 damage to that player.

If you are void in {G}, spells you cast cost {2} less to cast.
