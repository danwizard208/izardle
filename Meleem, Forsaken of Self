Mana cost: {C}{W}{U}{R}{G}
Legendary Creature Enchantment - Avatar

When you cast Meleem, Forsaken of Self,
each player gains 2 life and draws a card,
then you may gain 2 life and draw a card.

{W}{U}{R}{G}: Return Meleem, Forsaken of Self to its owners hand,
then each player puts a 1/1 colourless spirit creature token into play.
Activate this ability only if you are void in black.
