Legendary Creature Enchantment - Avatar

When Raltorsh, Forsaken of Reason enters the battlefield,
you may search your library for a basic land card and put that card onto the
battlefield tapped.

At the beginning of your upkeep, if you are void in blue, put a 1/1
colourless spirit creature token with haste and lifelink into play.
It has "When you draw a card, if it is not the first card you drew this turn,
sacrifice this creature."
