In the beginning there was an Ur-Avatar, an Avatar of purest mana.
Some event occurred and it was torn assunder, into 5 pieces.
The tearing ripped a piece of mana out of each of the 5 pieces,
resulting in Avatars for each missing piece.
These came to be known as the Forsaken.
Their plane is a sort of surrealist place:
Everywhere you go, things are almost, but not quite, normal.

A possible idea: the event (lets say the Cataclysm) is also responsible for
the birth of the Eldrazi. The Eldrazi represent the holes in mana and the
distortions in reality brought about.
They are the missing pieces of the forsaken, warped and twisted.
This is the origin of the name izardle. It's a working name, not final.

Possible name for the Ur-Avatar: the Primordium.
