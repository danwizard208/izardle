In the beginning there was an Ur-Avatar, an Avatar of purest mana.
Some event occurred and it was torn assunder, into 5 pieces.
The tearing ripped a piece of mana out of each of the 5 pieces,
resulting in Avatars for each missing piece.
These came to be known as the Forsaken.
Their plane is a sort of surrealist place:
Everywhere you go, things are almost, but not quite, normal.
